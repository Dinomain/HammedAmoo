Ensuring that your dataset is stored as efficiently as possible is crucial for allowing these models to run on a more reasonable timescale without having to reduce the size of the dataset.\n\nYou've been hired by a major online data science training provider called *Training Data Ltd.* to clean up one of their largest customer datasets. This dataset will eventually be used to predict whether their students are looking for a new job or not, information that they will then use to direct them to prospective recruiters.\n\nYou've been given access to `customer_train.csv`, which is a subset of their entire customer dataset, so you can create a proof-of-concept of a much more efficient storage solution. The dataset contains anonymized student information, and whether they were looking for a new job or not during training:\n\n| Column       | Description                                  |\n|------------- |--------------------------------------------- |\n| `student_id`   | A unique ID for each student.                 |\n| `city`  | A code for the city the student lives in.  |\n| `city_development_index` | A scaled development index for the city.       |\n| `gender` | The student's gender.       |\n| `relevant_experience` | An indicator of the student's relevant experience.       |\n| `enrolled_university` | The type of university course enrolled in (if any).       |\n| `education_level` | The student's education level.       |\n| `major_discipline` | The educational discipline of the student.       |\n| `experience` | The student's total experience (in years).       |\n| `company_size` | The number of employees at the student's current employer.       |\n| `last_new_job` | The number of years between the student's current and previous jobs.       |\n| `training_hours` | The number of hours of training completed.       |\n| `job_change` | An indicator of whether the student is looking for a new job (`1`) or not (`0`).       |","metadata":{},"id":"a09e6d54-bf3f-4632-b299-bd49d5c80d5f","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Start your code here!\nimport pandas as pd","metadata":{"executionTime":129,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Start your code here!\nimport pandas as pd"},"id":"eda9c1b2-4e9a-41ac-8da6-d4c98775f986","cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"source":"#Read the Dataset\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"customer_train.csv\")\n\ndf.head()\n\ndf.dtypes\n\n\n","metadata":{"executionTime":100,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"#Read the Dataset\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"customer_train.csv\")\n\ndf.head()\n\ndf.dtypes\n\n\n"},"id":"dc90b8f9-aa15-4096-9338-dae4467a0fea","cell_type":"code","execution_count":7,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","execution_count":7,"data":{"text/plain":"student_id                  int64\ncity                       object\ncity_development_index    float64\ngender                     object\nrelevant_experience        object\nenrolled_university        object\neducation_level            object\nmajor_discipline           object\nexperience                 object\ncompany_size               object\ncompany_type               object\nlast_new_job               object\ntraining_hours              int64\njob_change                float64\ndtype: object"},"metadata":{}}]},{"source":"#Covert all columns with integers to int32\n\ndf[\"student_id\"] = df[\"student_id\"].astype(\"int32\")\ndf[\"training_hours\"] = df[\"training_hours\"].astype(\"int32\")\n\n#Covert all columns with floats to to float16\n\ndf[\"city_development_index\"] = df[\"city_development_index\"].astype(\"float16\")\ndf[\"job_change\"] = df[\"job_change\"].astype(\"float16\")\n\ndf.dtypes[df.dtypes == \"object\"]\n\n#Convert nominal categorical data to category data type\n\ndf[[\"gender\", \"relevant_experience\",\"education_level\", \"enrolled_university\",\"major_discipline\",\"company_type\"]].astype(\"category\")\n\ndf.head()\n\n#Convert ordinal category columns to ordered category\n\n\n","metadata":{"executionTime":55,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"#Covert all columns with integers to int32\n\ndf[\"student_id\"] = df[\"student_id\"].astype(\"int32\")\ndf[\"training_hours\"] = df[\"training_hours\"].astype(\"int32\")\n\n#Covert all columns with floats to to float16\n\ndf[\"city_development_index\"] = df[\"city_development_index\"].astype(\"float16\")\ndf[\"job_change\"] = df[\"job_change\"].astype(\"float16\")\n\ndf.dtypes[df.dtypes == \"object\"]\n\n#Convert nominal categorical data to category data type\n\ndf[[\"gender\", \"relevant_experience\",\"education_level\", \"enrolled_university\",\"major_discipline\",\"company_type\"]].astype(\"category\")\n\ndf.head()\n\n#Convert ordical category columns to ordered category\n\ndf[\"education_level\"].dtype\n"},"id":"69845033-ea2b-4d4c-9f7a-0f49c7620230","cell_type":"code","execution_count":49,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","execution_count":49,"data":{"text/plain":"dtype('O')"},"metadata":{}}]}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.8.10","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"editor":"DataCamp Workspace"},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
